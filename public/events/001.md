# Evergreen, Hercynia // 3.19.5014U

 In the morning, the squad went to the **GOVERNOR'S FARM** for their meeting with **PATIENCE** and **EDENA JI**.

 During this meeting **PATIENCE** described the situation surrounding the attacks on **EVERGREEN** Colonists. Attacks have been occuring for a little over a year; mostly in the **GRAY TOWNS** and against travelling convoys, but attacks against **EVERGREEN** itself is not uncommon, as evidence by the active sniper threat outside the settlement.

 Many militia members have been spreading stories that the attacks are being carried out by giant bugs. **EGREGORIANS**, giant, hexepedal, insect-like creatures that once inhabited **HERCYNIA**. **PATIENCE** dismisses these as scare tactics, and pulls up footage showing Human assailants using natural materials and chitinous covering to appear more insect-like in combat.

 **PATIENCE** also touches on the history of **HERCYNIA**, noting that **SECCOMM** had some sort of interaction with these **EGREGORIANS** while on the planet, but the population seems to have shrunk since those times.

 The squad is then provided two different urgent matters that could use their attention:

 - The sniper that is plaguing the colony needs to be taken care of, both for the safety of the colonists, as well as a potential lead of where these attacks are coming from.
 - **CHIEF ENGINEER CASTOR FIELDING** needs an armed escort to help bring supplies to **EVERGREEN'S** landing bowl so that the Engineering team can get to work repairing the sinkholes that have opened up. These repairs would allow larger ships to land at **EVERGREEN** and will help it's infrastructure and trade grow significantly.

 In the end, both of these missions are very important, and on an urgent timescale.

 The squad decides to help the Engineers, and **EDENA JI** shows them to the **PRINT SHOP** where they are able to begin printing their Mechs as well as meet **CASTOR FIELDING** and his Engineers. 

# Evergreen Outskirts // 3.19.5014U

 Piloting their newly-printed mechs, the squad escorts three **EVERGREEN COLONIAL ENGINEERING CORPS (CEC)** trucks full of supplies for the repair toward the landing bown, a few kilometers South of **EVERGREEN**.

 As they near the bowl, they start to see movment in the trees. Then, laser fire. They're under attack. The squad is forced to try to escort the trucks and engineers the rest of the way under duress.

 The squad is able to defeat the attackers; a group of armed soldiers, as well as a number of mechs decorated in foliage, feathers, old chitinous material, and other strange additions to their armor. The mechs seem to be very old, possible savlaged and repaired over a long period of time.

 As the **CEC** begins setting up pumps and initial repairs on the landing bowl, the pilots catch their breath and begin some field repairs on their mechs. **CHEIF ENGINEER FIELDING** approached the squad, thanking them for the protection, and offers to reward them with a few **CORE BATTERIES** he has squirreled away back at the Print Shop.

 **Pharaoh** finds an enemy pilot bleeding out in the remains of their chassis, and manages to extract and stabalize them. They are transported back to **Evergreen** with the **CEC**.

 A few hours later, and the convoy begins its journey back to **EVERGREEN**. However, on the way, **PATIENCE** contacts the pilots and informs them that a distress signal from the SouthEast of **EVERGREEN** have been intercepted, and as the pilots are the closest considerable force to the originating signal, they would like the group to go and investigate.

 The general originating point of the distress signal is discovered to be the **GREY TOWNS**, specifically **CHAU MAIZE**, as an audio message is recieved from **ALBERT CHAU** who claims that his family's farm has been surrounded by hundreds of subalterns.

 Near early evening, the squad makes it to the farm. On the road to the farmhouse, they observe a handful of subalterns trudging their way through the fields, away from the farm, toward the East/NorthEast. They don't seem to pay any attention to the pilots, but **SPECTRE** sets his personal drone to keep an eye on them.

 At the farm, **ALBERT**'s claims are confirmed, as there are hundreds of subalterns, drones, and a handful of mech-like machines that appear to have been cobbled together out of said subalterns, drones, and other machines. Near the farmhouse is a large pile of machinery that seems to be sending out huge amounts of errant code to the surrounding machines. **[THE BROADCAST]**

 As the squad attempts to approach the farmhouse, the subalterns begin to react, forming a ravenous hoard that makes traversing the farmland difficult and dangerous, and the larger machines being to move in for an attack.

 Another hard battle ensues, resulting in **SUNRISE**'s mech being destroyed completely. But, in the end, the threat seems to be eliminated, and **ALBERT CHAU** and his family are able to leave the boarded-up confines of their home.

 The squad meets the **CHAU** family, and learns that their COMP/CON unit had been acting strange in the days leading up to the subaltern siege on the farm.

 **SPECTRE** and **GOOSE** take a look at the malfunctioning unit, and reveal a strange message, emitting in Old Union code. This message seems to be broadcast all throughout the surrounding area. **GOOSE** pins down the strongest emination of the signal to be relayed through the nearby Omninode Tower.

 Through some work **SPECTRE** is able to cordon off part of the infecting code as a possible tool for future encounters, although he infects his NHP in the process.

 On their way away from the farm, the squad checks the remains of their defeated enemies, and finds that they weren't mechs, but some sort of machines that were moving on their own, although parts of their makeup looks to be parts scrapped from old mechanized chassis.

 The squad returns to **EVERGREEN** and reports their findings to **PATIENCE**, and takes some well deserved rest.

# Evergreen // 3.20 - 5.17.5014U

 The squad has a few weeks of downtime to rest and get settled in **EVERGREEN**

 - **SANDMAN**, with the help of **GOOSE** spends some time investigating some of the old ruins around the colony, finding scrap material and useful items in the wreckage

 - **PHARAOH** talks to **EDINA JI** about gaining access to the colony datastore to track down as much information as she can about the supposed **EGREGORIANS** that inhabited **HERCYNIA** before the colony.

 - The time that **SPECTRE** didn't spend working with **ANGEL** to remove the infection was either spent talking about drone technology with **YUUKI WELLINGTON** or teaching **PHARAOH** some basics of hacking.

 - **STRANGE CARGO** spent much of his downtime at the **BOTTOM OF THE WELL**, having a good time, blowing off steam, but not necessarily making a good name for himself. He then worked with **BRAVA** on a "melee combat course" that turned into more of his own Fight Club.

 - **SUNRISE** attempted to track down black-market information about where these attacks may be coming from, and ended up with some strange stories, and a rumor about a colony in a tunnel to the North-West.
