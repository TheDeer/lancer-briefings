**PATIENCE** calls a defense council meeting. Among the notable attendees are: the Lancer squad and  **EDINA JI** as well as **BRAVA HADURA** and several higher-ranking milita members.

The pilots are thanked for their help so far in keeping **EVERGREEN** safe from the raider attacks. **PATIENCE** makes it clear that, while the erratic subaltern behavior is strange and concerning, the raider attacks are their primary concern, and should be the primary concern of the pilots, as well.

**PATIENCE** believes that they may have "kicked the hornet's nest" with the latest defensive retaliation against these raiders, and believes that **EVERGREEN** will soon be hit by a much larger force. They put the colony on red-alert and ask the squad to stay near the colony to help with the defensive.

The pilots are awoken by the sound of small arms fire, explosions, and panicked radio chatter. **EVERGREEN** is under attack. They rush to their mechs and head to where the largest force is reported to be.

Just outside the walls, they are met with a heavy siege force, that they prepare to defend against.
